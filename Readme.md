# Project Title: epeer â€“ Decentralized Energy Exchange on FireFly and Cardano

## Project Description

**epeer** is an innovative decentralized energy trading platform built on top of the **FireFly** framework and the **Cardano blockchain**. The project aims to enable individuals, households, and microgrids to **track, trade, and balance renewable energy** in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof environment.

Each participant runs a FireFly node and has access to a **personal energy dashboard** where they can monitor:

- Their **produced energy**
- Their **current consumption**
- **Recent transactions**
- Network-wide **events** such as new offers or trading opportunities

Energy data is randomly generated (in early development) by scripts and pushed to FireFly, simulating real-world smart meter input. The platform uses **Cardano smart contracts** to record trades and enforce allocation rules, pricing, and incentives. Smart contracts are compiled to WASM components using the **Balius** framework and deployed through the **FireFly Cardano connector**.

## Key Features

- real-time tracking of energy production and consumption  
- peer-to-peer energy exchange via Cardano smart contracts  
- ai-driven algorithms (AMA) for supply-demand matching  
- fully decentralized with FireFly multiparty coordination  
- tokenization of energy credits using NFTs or fungible tokens  

## Technology Stack

- **FireFly** for orchestration and multiparty workflows  
- **Cardano** blockchain for secure and scalable smart contracts  
- **Balius** WASM framework for cross-platform contract components  
- **Rust** and **TypeScript** for backend/frontend implementation
- **Aiken** for Cardano Smart Contract Development  
- **SQLite** for local state management 
- **Docker** and for deployment and node setup

## Vision

The goal is to create a **trustless energy network** that incentivizes local renewable energy production and enables a more efficient and democratic energy economy.
